# Either

A fully typed, zero dependency implementation of the functional programming Either object for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Eithers are incredibly useful for functions that may throw an error. Throwing an error breaks the control flow of your program. The Either object is functional programming's solutions to handling functions that may error or succeed (and return a value).
